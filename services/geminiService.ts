Use specific keywords for an AI image generator. Break it down into logical categories (e.g., 'Face', 'Hair', 'Attire'). Combine all character sheets into a single markdown string under a main "Character Sheets" heading.
    3.  **Write Story Script:** Write a ${storyLength}, compelling story based on the title and the characters you invented.
    4.  **Generate Character Descriptions:** For each character you invented, create a separate JSON object containing their name and a detailed, self-contained, prompt-style description of their appearance. This description should be dense with visual keywords.
    5.  **Final JSON:** Populate the 'characterSheet', 'storyScript', and 'characters' fields in the JSON output. Do NOT generate 'prompts'.

    1.  First, create a highly detailed, descriptive "Character Sheet" for **EACH** character based on the details provided. This sheet is crucial for visual consistency. Use specific keywords for an AI image generator. Break it down into logical categories (e.g., 'Face', 'Hair', 'Attire'). Combine all character sheets into a single markdown string under a main "Character Sheets" heading.
    2.  Then, based on the scene description, generate ${numPrompts} distinct, sequential JSON prompt objects that depict the unfolding action within that scene. Imagine it as a short storyboard.
    3.  **CRITICAL RULE for each JSON prompt object:**
        -   \`scene_number\`: The chronological order of the scene, starting from 1.
        -   \`start_time_seconds\` and \`end_time_seconds\`: Calculate these based on an 8-second duration for each scene (e.g., scene 1 is 0-8s, scene 2 is 8-16s, etc.).
        -   \`prompt\`: This string MUST begin with the video style: "${videoStyle}". Then, for **ANY** character mentioned by name, you **MUST** include their detailed appearance from their character sheet to maintain consistency. This should be followed by a description of the action, environment, lighting, and mood. The prompt string MUST end with "--ar 16:9".
    4.  Populate the 'characterSheet' and 'prompts' fields in the JSON output. Do not generate a 'storyScript' or 'characters'.

        2.  **Character Focus:** The thumbnail MUST feature the main character(s) prominently. Their faces should be clearly visible and expressive, conveying strong emotion (e.g., shock, joy, determination, fear). Use a close-up or medium shot. Incorporate their specific, detailed appearance from the character sheet for consistency.
        3.  **High Drama & Intrigue:** Describe a compelling, action-packed, or emotionally charged moment from the story. Create a sense of mystery or conflict that makes the viewer want to know what happens next.
        4.  **Vibrant & Dynamic Composition:** Use keywords for a dynamic and visually appealing composition. Emphasize vibrant colors, dramatic lighting (e.g., "god rays," "neon glow," "rim lighting"), and a clear focal point. Think "cinematic," "epic," "intense."
        5.  **Title Integration (Optional but Recommended):** If a story title is provided, subtly hint at it visually. Do not write text on the image, but use elements that represent the title. For example, for 'The Last Dragon Rider', show a character with a dragon.
        6.  **Clarity & Detail:** Be extremely descriptive about every element to leave no room for ambiguity for the AI.
        7.  **Aspect Ratio:** The prompt MUST end with "--ar 16:9".
        8.  **Output:** Your entire output should be ONLY the final image prompt text, with no extra explanations or labels.
